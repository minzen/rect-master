# Project Rect-Master

This is a simple guessing game built on ReactJS. The user is supposed to select one location of the provided one, where she thinks the photo has been shot at. The image is gradually revealed to the user. If the time runs out or the user answers incorrectly the game is ended.

## Building and running

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn install`

to install the required dependencies.

### `yarn start`

to start the application. The command runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
